## Andy
- RECORD first hour or so of sprint
- use wimlds channel on gitter for communication
- go over Git in the morning
- when attendees ask questions, please answer the women's questions first
- encourage attendees to follow up on their work; let them know to expect a lot of back / forth, it's part of the process.   It is worth the experience to see a PR through to the merge state
- go over policy of "abandoned / stalled PRs".  Better etiquette is to communicate status.  
- remind people to watch their GitHub notifications.  (many people use an alternative email address that they do not check often, or it gets filtered into a gmail folder)
